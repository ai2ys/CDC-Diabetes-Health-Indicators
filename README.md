## Introduction

📖
This project uses the [CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators) dataset for training a model to predict if a patient is diabetic/pre-diabetic or does not have diabetes based on the patients heath records.


**Problem:** Diabetes is a severe illness that can lead to serious health problems such as heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and so on. Detecting the illness in an early stage can help to prevent or delay these health problems.

**Task:** This midterm project aims to build a service that predicts whether a patient has diabetes, is pre-diabetic, or healthy using data provided by the "Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset" provided by the CDC. 

More information about the dataset can be found in the [Dataset Information](#dataset-information) section.

The dataset used in this project was created to to better understand the relationship between lifestyle and diabetes in the US and the creation was funded by the [CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention)](https://www.cdc.gov/).

## Dataset Information
📋 Information regarding the dataset
- Source and download location
- Features variables
- Target variable

🔗 Dataset page: [CDC Diabetes Health Indicators](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators)

The [CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators) is available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/). 

- Each row of the dataset represents a person participating in the study.
- The dataset contains 21 feature variables (categorical and integer) and 1 target variable (binary).
- Cross validation or a fixed train-test split could be used for data splits. 
- It contains sensitive data such as gender, income, and education level. 
- Data preprocessing was performed by bucketing of age. The dataset has no missing values. 


**Quoted from the dataset page**<br>

> *"The Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset contains healthcare statistics and lifestyle survey information about people in general along with their diagnosis of diabetes. The 35 features consist of some demographics, lab test results, and answers to survey questions for each patient. The target variable for classification is whether a patient has diabetes, is pre-diabetic, or healthy."*

**Remark on the quote above**<br>
The quote states that the dataset contains 35 features. However, the dataset page further states

>|  | Information |
>| :--- | :--- |
>| Dataset Characteristics | Tabular, Multivariate |
>| Subject Area | Life Science |
>| Associated Tasks | Classification |
>| Feature Type | Categorical, Integer |
>| \# Instances | 253680 |
>| \# Features | 21 |

💡 We will check this discrepancy in when digging into the dataset during the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

➡️ From the dataset information we can see that the task will be a binary classification task with 21 features and 1 target variable.


**Download is provided via**

1. Python API using the `ucimlrepo` package.
    - When using the `ucimlrepo` package for downloading the data, there is an additional download link provided in its `metadata.data_url` from which the dataset CSV file can be accessed directly.
    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/891/data.csv
1. On the project page (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators) there is a reference to the dataset source which redirects to Kaggle:<br>

💡 In this project, we utilize the ucimlrepo Python package to download the initial dataset. To ensure reproducibility, all relevant data for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and training will be stored locally. This approach safeguards against potential issues, such as unavailability or changes to the dataset in the UCI Machine Learning Repository over time.

📥 How the dataset was downloaded and stored locally is described in the EDA notebook [`eda.ipynb`](eda.ipynb). The dataset and parts of the metadata is downloaded and stored in the [./dataset](dataset) folder locally.
- dataframe - [./dataset/data.csv](dataset/data.csv)
- information about variables - [./dataset/variables.csv](dataset/variables.csv)
- metadata (only some parts of it) - [./dataset/metadata_partially.json](dataset/metadata_partially.json)


## EDA and Model Training

📊 EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis, which is the process of analyzing data sets to summarize the main characteristics, often including visualizations of the data. EDA is used for seeing what the data can tell us about the data.

🧠 Model training is the process of training a machine learning model to make predictions based on data. The model training process includes the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing
1. Model training
1. Model evaluation

📓 The EDA and model training will be performed in a Jupyter Notebook [`eda.ipynb`](eda.ipynb). In this notebook, we will perform the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Data preprocessing
1. Model training
    - Different algorithms (tree-based and linear models)
    - Different hyperparameters
1. Model evaluation
1. Model selection

All required steps for setting up the virtual environment to run the notebook are described in the [🛠️ Virtual Environment Setup](#virtual-environment-setup) section.

🐍 For training the final model after the model selection step we will extract the required Python code to a script called [`train.py`](train.py). This notebook will be used to train the final model and save it to disk. Steps covered in the [`train.py`](train.py) script will be:

1. Data preprocessing
1. Model training
1. Model evaluation
1. Model storage

### Virtual Environment Setup

🐍 Setting up the virtual environment for 📊 EDA and 🧠 Model Training using **Miniconda** with Python `3.10.12`. All required packages will be installed from the [`requirements-eda.txt`](requirements-eda.txt) file. There the packages are listed with their version number to ensure reproducibility.

1. Installing Miniconda
    - Follow the instruction from for your host OS:\
    https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/

1. Creating the virtual environment using Python 3.10.12
    ```bash
    conda create --name mlzoomcamp-midterm python=3.10.12
    ```	

1. Activating the virtual environment
    ```bash
    conda activate mlzoomcamp-midterm
    ```
    - The command prompt should now indicate that the virtual environment is activated and show the name of the virtual environment in parentheses `(mlzoomcamp-midterm)`.\
    Within the activated virtual environment `(mlzoomcamp-midterm)` perform the following steps:

        1. Install the requirements from the [`requirements-eda.txt`](requirements-eda.txt) 
            ```bash
            pip install -r requirements-eda.txt
            ```
        1. Start JupyterLab to check if the installation was successful
            ```bash
            jupyter lab
            ```

#### EDA - missing values, duplicates, imbalances, etc.

💡Information revealed about the dataset during 📊EDA regarding
- Missing values
    - ✅ As stated in the dataset information, the dataset has no missing values
- Duplicates
    - ✅ There are duplicate rows in the dataset when not taking into account the patient ID. This is due to the fact that feature variables are categorical, binary and integer. The integer values have either only value ranges between 1 and 30 or are discrete values although the original values were floating point (feature `BMI`). Therefore these rows represent different patients that just represent the same feature variables due to their nature.
- Imbalances
    - ✅ The dataset is highly imbalanced with respect to the target varibale
        - 14% (pre-)diabetic
        - 86% non-diabetic


The [BMI (body mass index)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) is calculated using the following formula. The result is a floating point number, but in the dataset the BMI is stored as an integer. This means that the BMI is rounded to the next integer. 

$$
BMI_{\text{float}} = \frac{mass_{kg}}{height_{m}^2}
\\
BMI_{\text{integer}} = \text{integer}\left(\frac{mass_{kg}}{height_{m}^2} + 0.5 \right)
$$




### Export notebook to Python scrip
📤Information on training code exported to the 🐍 Python script. The script will cover the following tasks:
- Loading the dataset splits: train, validation, and test
- Creating a 'full training' dataset consisting of training and validation splits
- Creating a test dataset consisting of the test split
- Training the model on the 'full training' dataset
- Evaluating the model on the test dataset
- Saving the following data to files (bin and json)
    - Model
    - DictVectorizer (fitted on 'full training' dataset)
    - Normalization values (determined on 'full training' dataset in order to normalize the value ranges of some feature variables)

All code that is required for training the final model will be exported to the [`train.py`](train.py) file.

🐍 Make sure the development environment defined in section [🛠️ Virtual Environment Setup](#virtual-environment-setup) is activated before running the following commands.

```bash
# Activate the development environment
conda activate mlzoomcamp-midterm

# ▶️ Execute the 🐍 Python script
python train.py
```

For later testing the model with the predict service sample a patient's data information from the test dataset. For this purpose the following script can be used to randomly sampling a test dataset entry. The sample will be stored to [`test_sample.json`](test_sample.json).

```bash
# randomly
python sample_from_test.py

# using a specific seed value
python sample_from_test.py --seed 1234
```

This [`test_sample.json`](test_sample.json) will be used when testing the model during the next step the Model Deployment.
